After compiled, the executable file must be run on the command line passing two parameters:
1. starting vertex index; and
2.  ending vertex index

The problem information in the DIMACS standard must also be passed in standard input (stdin). 

Here's an example:

dijkstra 1 2 < NY.gr

The program returns the shortest path distance value on standard output (stdou).
